# PI-Dogs-FrontEnd
Front End of my personal project for coding bootcamp SoyHenry. I had to use the following technologies:
- Sequelize
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

Also, all the dogs' information had to come from <a href="https://thedogapi.com/">The Dog API</a> and store in database the necessary information (such as all the dogs' temperaments and custom dogs inputed by user)

# How to start on local
1- Open your bash terminal

2- Write "npm install"

3- Wait for completation, then write "npm start"

This must be done for the <a href="https://github.com/LeonardoRosales1485/PI-Dogs-BackEnd">BackEnd</a> of this project as well

# Front End Known Issues

* When realoading in a dog detail route, the component does not recieve the information needed and crashes the app
* Filter options not showing as intended (Temporally fixed with reset button)

# What to do at this app

- You can search for dog's breed and find information about them!
- Filters by name and temperaments are available (It was a requirement for approbal not to use API endpoints).
- Sorting by weight and alphabetically (It was a requirement for approbal not to use API endpoints).
